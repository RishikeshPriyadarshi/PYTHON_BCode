#Math-Funcn ---> round, abs, pow, max

x = 3.14
#y = -4
y=4
z = 5

#result = round(x)
#result = abs(y) -->abs i.e. absolute value is the distance away from whole number so -4 abs is 4
#result = pow(y,3)
#result = pow(4,3)
#result = max(x,y,z) --> max gives the maxium among numbers
result = min(x,y,z)


print(result)
